# ORA - Open REST API
The objective of ORA is to create data procedurally that can be used to create temporary databases or used directly in testing front-end and mobile applications, the ease comes from using Docker for this, the front-end and mobile developer will have a tool simulating the back-end without having to master a lot of knowledge to do so.

# About development
At the moment ORA is still in the prototyping and development phase, we are testing concepts and usability, but feel free to contribute and suggest improvements.
